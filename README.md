# Lost in Space Track — Hackathon

Autonomous Earth-observation scheduling on a small satellite. Teams write a Python function that plans attitude slews and shutter windows for a single LEO pass over a fixed ground target, respecting reaction-wheel momentum limits, body-rate smear constraints, and a 60° off-nadir pointing envelope. Submissions are scored automatically against three pass geometries (0°, 30°, 60° off-nadir) using a Basilisk 6-DoF simulation on the organizers' side.

## For participants

1. **Read the problem statement** → [`docs/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`](./docs/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md) (PDF also available)
2. **Download the testing kit** → clone this repo or grab the latest [release](../../releases)
3. **Start from a stub** → copy `teams_kit/example_submissions/stop_and_stare.py` and edit
4. **Score locally** →
   ```bash
   cd teams_kit/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python test_my_submission.py my_submission.py
   ```
5. **Submit** → see [`SUBMITTING.md`](./SUBMITTING.md)

You will ultimately deliver:

- **One Python file** exporting `plan_imaging(...)` per Section 7 of the problem statement
- **A 2-minute presentation** explaining your strategy

Presentations are judged first; top 3 submissions are then verified against the real Basilisk harness.

## About the harness

The organizer-side grader is open-sourced alongside the problem statement for full transparency. You can read exactly how your submission will be evaluated, what the scoring gates look like, and how frames are counted. The only thing teams cannot run locally is the Basilisk 6-DoF simulation itself (`organizer_harness/basilisk_harness/basilisk_sim.py` requires [AVS Lab's Basilisk](https://hanspeterschaub.info/basilisk)) — but the mock simulator in the teams' kit uses the identical validator, scorer, and gate logic, so local scores are honest directional indicators.
